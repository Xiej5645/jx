# Personal blog website using Jekyll 
This is the repository for my planned personal blog website. Using Jekyll (Ruby, HTML, css, scss, js) specifically the theme: jekyll-theme-chirpy to build the website and GitHub Pages to host it. 

Official repo for the theme is here: [https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/)
