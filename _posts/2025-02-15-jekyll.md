## Welcome to my new Jekyll site! 
A blog site is what I have in mind. I'm excited to be using Jekyll, a static site generator written in Ruby. It is suppose to make managing blog posts easier, and recommended by many whom used Jekyll for their blog sites. I have never used Ruby before, but have heard of Jekyll templates. This video introduced me to the Chirpy Jekyll theme:

> Before I continue, here is a brief introduction of myself :) 
I am currently a sophomore computer science undergrad, also pursuing a dual major in Chinese. Chinese is an amazing language, which connects me to my community and broadens my horizons. Meanwhile, I love exploring new technologies and seeing innovations that improves people's lives, or solve a problem. It's always a pleasure to help others and I hope what I develop or my experience could be of any help to you or myself in the future.

# Get started with Jekyll
The first and the most important step  step to getting start with Jekyll is...
*Drum rolls*
[**visiting the official site**](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}, but the step may be a bit different than expected. You have to first download ruby, then via command line use Ruby gem command to install Jekyll
`gem install jekyll bundler`
and then you can start from scratch:
`bundle init` to create a `Gemfile`, that lists the project's dependencies
```
#in Gemfile you can just list your dependencies like this
gem "jekyll"
```
then   
`bundle` or `bundle install` to get Jekyll and dependencies to start the project

## Practical usage
Although we can start from scratch, but that defeats the purpose of Jekyll. One of the main reasons people use Jekyll is the minimal amount of time spent to code your own site. However, I would argue that you still need to know the basics. HTML, CSS, JS. 
Why minimal? Because we can use templates, there are amazing people who already created for us. These templates also refer to as "Themes" can save you time. I recommmend looking at other repo that were made from forking the template. You can get inspiration from them too. 
Structure of Jekyll
```
_includes (folder for like components)
_layout (layout of different types of sites, e.g. home.html, about.html, page.html, posts.html)
_posts (blog article stored here)
_site (you can ignore this, it's the static site folder generated from other folders)
_sass (scss and css styling goes here)
assets (addtional custom css, img, favicons goes here)
Gemfile (core file that lists project's dependencies)
_config.yml (it's liek the setting's file, you can customize most site information here, e.g. title, social account/contact links)
index.html (Jekyll supports .html and .md or .markdown)
about.md
```
There are also other files but usually hidden or should not be modified. 

The cmds to test and run project locally
`bundle exec jekyll serve`
or
`bundle exec jekyll s`
optional parameters --watch, --no-watch
watch: allows regeneration of static site while hosted often port 4000 
no-watch: disables regeneration feature, whatever new edits/modifications you save would trigger regeneration of static site
Note: if you modify config.yml, regeneration feature won't be triggered, you need to re-serve the site

Also recommended to serve Jekyll site in a dev container / docker to maintian consistent development environment. (optional) 

Dev containers and docker is another big topic, I am not proficient in them yet. 
here is a list of dev container tempaltes: [https://containers.dev/templates](https://containers.dev/templates){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
you can think of dev containers as an isolated space where specific templates such as Jekyll, which I used for this site during development, is made specifically for Jekyll. Dev containers also reduces unexpected errors when developing projects from one device to another, as I mentioned that they are like their own isolated environment.  

## Some git commands I used for this project were:
Check current remote repository
- `git remote -v`

Set/change url of exisiting remote repo e.g. named `origin` 
- `git remote set-url origin your_repo_git`

Initialize git repository (add a .git folder to current directory)
- `git init`

Stage files for commit e.g. `.` means all file in current directory
- `git add .`

Stage a specific file for commit e.g. `"file_name"` in string/inside quote: your file_name
- `git add "file_name"`

Make commit with commit message 
- `git commit -m "msg"`

Configure User information for git to use when you make commit or push
- `git config user.name "name_here"`
- `git config user.email "email_here"`

git config also have optional parameter `--global`

Push changes to GitHub, I used `main` for the (main/master) branch I want to make change to  

- `git push origin main`
- `git push origin main --force`
<br/>rebase is another great one, but I didn't use.
again `main` here is a branch name aka the main branch, rebase used to rewrite commit history 
- `git rebase main`

an empty commit using `--allow-empty`, `Trigger rebuild` is just the commit message:
```
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger rebuild"
git push
```
**Additional Notes**
If you encounter the error fatal: No such remote 'origin', it means the remote repository hasnâ€™t been added yet. 
Use: `git remote add origin` to add it first .
The term `origin` is just a convention for naming the primary remote repository. You can use any name you prefer.

Alright that's it for Jekyll. It was hard finding solutions to errors I got while working on this Jekyll site, but trial and error was the way to go and Google/Internet is always there.
Let's see how far I can go, the future is filled with uncertainties and possibilities.
