Welcome to my new Jekyll site! A blog site is what I have in mind. I'm excited to be using Jekyll, a static site generator written in Ruby. It is suppose to make managing blog posts easier, and recommended by many whom used Jekyll for their blog sites. I have never used Ruby before, but have heard of Jekyll templates. This video introduced me to the Chirpy Jekyll theme:

> Before I continue, here is a brief introduction of myself :) 
I am currently a sophomore computer science undergrad, also pursuing a dual major in Chinese. Chinese is an amazing language, which connects me to my community and broadens my horizons. Meanwhile, I love exploring new technologies and seeing innovations that improves people's lives, or solve a problem. It's always a pleasure to help others and I hope what I develop or my experience could be of any help to you or myself in the future.

# Get started with Jekyll
The first and the most important step  step to getting start with Jekyll is...
*Drum rolls*
[**visiting the official site**](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/), but the step may be a bit different than expected. You have to first download ruby, then via command line use Ruby gem command to install Jekyll
`gem install jekyll bundler`
and then you can start from scratch:
`bundle init` to create a `Gemfile`, that lists the project's dependencies
```
#in Gemfile you can just list your dependencies like this
gem "jekyll"
```
then   
`bundle` or `bundle install` to get Jekyll and dependencies to start the project

# Start practical usage
Although we can start from scratch, but that defeats the purpose of Jekyll. One of the main reasons people use Jekyll is the minimal amount of time spent to code your own site. However, I would argue that you still need to know the basics. HTML, CSS, JS. 
Why minimal? Because we can use templates, there are amazing people who already created for us. These templates also refer to as "Themes" can save you time. I recommmend looking at other repo that were made from forking the template. You can get inspiration from them too. 
Structure of Jekyll
```
_includes (folder for like components)
_layout (layout of different types of sites, e.g. home.html, about.html, page.html, posts.html)
_posts (blog article stored here)
_site (you can ignore this, it's the static site folder generated from other folders)
_sass (scss and css styling goes here)
assets (addtional custom css, img, favicons goes here)
Gemfile (core file that lists project's dependencies)
_config.yml (it's liek the setting's file, you can customize most site information here, e.g. title, social account/contact links)
index.html (Jekyll supports .html and .md or .markdown)
about.md
```
there are also other files but usually hidden or should not be modified. 

cmds to test and run project locally
`bundle exec jekyll serve`
or
`bundle exec jekyll s`
optional parameters --watch, --no-watch
watch: allows regeneration of static site while hosted often port 4000 
no-watch: disables regeneration feature, whatever new edits/modifications you save would trigger regeneration of static site
Note: if you modify config.yml, regeneration feature won't be triggered, you need to re-serve the site

Also recommended to serve Jekyll site in a dev container / docker to maintian consistent development environment. (optional) 

Dev containers and docker is another big topic, I am not proficient in them yet. 
here is a list of dev container tempaltes: [https://containers.dev/templates](https://containers.dev/templates)
you can think of dev containers as an isolated space where specific templates such as Jekyll, which I used for this site during development, is made specifically for Jekyll. Dev containers also reduces unexpected errors when developing projects from one device to another, as I mentioned that they are like their own isolated environment.  

some git commands I used for this project were:

`git remote -v`
`git remote set-url origin your_repo_git`
`git init`
`git add .`
`git add "file_name"`
`git commit -m "msg"`
`git config user.name "name_here"`
`git config user.email "email_here"`
git config also have optional parameter --global
`git push origin main`
`git push origin main --force`
rebase is another great one, but I didn't use.

More resource, these themes can be used as reference when you want to create a website using a framework or not

Alright that's it for Jekyll. It was hard finding solutions to errors I got while working on this Jekyll site, but trial and error was the way to go and Google/Internet is always there.
Let's see how far I can go, not sure right now.
