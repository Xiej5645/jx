## Topic of the post
I'm starting Data structures and Algorithms. 
There are myriad of resources online, including free and paid. As a poor student, I will focus on free recourses.

- Must be FREE
- For me: Language can be in English or Chinese (Simplified/Traditional)
- I learn best with video and visuals
- I am open to grinding/practicing more over time

To grind/practice

## [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/explore/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
Technical interview questions and a large open community
- have many languages
- a must for software engineers (swe, sde, web dev, data scientist, etc. thats related)
- don't have to solve all, no requirements but try to notice patterns, practice problem solving (might think it's fun once you get better, according to posts I've read)
- Famous Blind 75 [https://leetcode.com/problem-list/oizxjoit/](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/oizxjoit/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
- Leetcode's collection: [https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/top-interview-questions-easy/](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/top-interview-questions-easy/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}

## [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
Same as LeetCode, but provides a better and clearer roadmap
- Has a pro plan [FREE content is enough]; lifetime/one year access
- Video on youtube and site, has a roadmap too! direct link below:
- [https://neetcode.io/roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}

## [https://pypup.com/roadmap](https://pypup.com/roadmap){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
Similar to NeetCode, and LeetCode but solely Python
- Python is the top language used for technical interviews
 - If you know more languages then great, but for technical interviews use Python
 - best for readability
 - many people know it, so they can understand your code/thought and help you. ðŸ˜Š
- Free features are enough, roadmap and questions
- [https://pypup.com/problems](https://pypup.com/problems){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}

## [LintCode](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
Used to be mostly Chinese, now moving towards English. The site is now mostly English and similar to LeetCode in many ways. 
- One Negative/Con is the (Chinese/English) ADs, not your expacted ADS but just frequent popups such as login via wechat or others (e.g. daily clock in, ðŸ¤£)
- also have courses, mainly Chinese and some paid and free, go with FREE ðŸ˜Š (e.g. Basic VUE, C, DSA explained, common practices! ) 
- you can change languages (English and Simplified Chinese)

## [https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/code){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
Learn DSA with visuals and practice, uses LeetCode problems
- have other tutorials and courses: system design, behavioral questions
- problems sort by company, like LeetCode, NeetCode and others  
- DeepDive into databases: for each: Redis, PostgreSQL, Database Indexing, etc.
- Go Check For Yourself!!!

## [HackerRank/roles-directory/](https://www.hackerrank.com/roles-directory/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
Currently the Main platform for OA (Online Assessment)
- There are other sites for OA but HackerRank is a popular one, for me (USA)
- The link is to the computer science (cs) tech roles that may or may not require programming, but you can see all the posibilities or roles you can apply to or get into 
- Also similar to LeetCode, you can learn with their courses by practicing solving their coding problems, goes from easy to hard. 
- Many resources on this site to be explored (e.g. their blog page)

## [AlgoMap.io](https://algomap.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
Saw this on Instagram ðŸ¤£, Instagram's algorithm working ðŸ¤£
- FREE, login via Google to track your progress
- Personally, I don't like logging in; That's fine, since content is open on GitHub and he made amazing YouTube videos for each problem!!!
- Awesome person (developer and content creator) and great site.

## [AlgoMonster/problems/stats](https://algo.monster/problems/stats){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"}
AlgoMonster is another resource I found on Instagram, another AD lol, wanted to give this a try. 
- Paid and Free content, as always go with the FREE
- Explore everything, `Start Here` tab, `Getting Started: Overview` and `Flowchart`, etc. :>

Have Fun Learning!!!

>**Note:** more resources coming, will try out Chinese sources first then add them here, if they're helpful. See you then.
